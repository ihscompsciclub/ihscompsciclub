# IMPORTANT

Run `npm create-react-app` in the folder before transfering github files to it.
(alternatively, run `npm create-react-app` on a different folder and just copy the files into project directory)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run these important scripts:


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

This allows you to publish your local machine's code onto the [repo website](ihscompsciclub.github.io). However, in order to be able to do it, please do the following steps:
- run `npm install github-pages` in your project directory
- That's it! (All the other stuff that you have to do has been done already, so all you have to do is `npm install github-pages` and then you can use `npm run deploy` to update ihscompsciclub.github.io)
- (Please use this power responsibly; while this is a public repo, unless you're in IHS comp sci club, contact 
[andy-phung](https://github.com/andy-phung) before updating our page.)

## Less important scripts

The following are less important scripts that I doubt you will use.
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
